# Drag-and-Drop-project
Drag and Drop webpage with HTML , CSS , JavaScript
 I make this project with HTML element and that can be drag and drop to another block using HTML and CSS.
 We can drag the HTML element from block1 to block2 and block2 to block1 with javascript.Here we will use JavaScript events called "dragstart" and "Drop" events.
